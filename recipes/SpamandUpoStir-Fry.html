        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
<li><b>Prepare Ingredients</b>: Dice the Spam, peel and slice the upo, and beat the eggs in a bowl.</li>
<li><b>Sauté Aromatics</b>: Heat a bit of cooking oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic (and chopped onion if using) and sauté until fragrant.</li>
<li><b>Cook Spam</b>: Add the diced Spam to the pan. Cook until it’s browned and slightly crispy.</li>
<li><b>Add Upo and Seasonings</b>: Add the sliced upo to the pan. Stir well to combine with the Spam. Add a splash of soy sauce or a tablespoon of oyster sauce, and cook until the upo is tender, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

<li><b>Serve</b>: Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
