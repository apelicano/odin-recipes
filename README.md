# odin-recipes
This is a simple recipe website, the first project under The Odin Project | Foundations Course > HTML Foundations

In particular, there will be a main index page with links to a few recipes I've actually tried out myself while my partner was out of the country for 2 weeks in August of 2024.

On a technical aspect, this will demo what I've learned so far about HTML, elements and tags, working with text, lists, links and images.
